# Object Detection Using OpenCV and MobileNet

## Overview

This project demonstrates object detection using OpenCV and the MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. It allows for real-time object detection in images and videos as well as with a webcam feed.

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance and security to autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this project, we leverage the power of the MobileNet architecture to detect and classify objects in real-world scenarios.


## Features

Object detection in images: The project provides the capability to load and process static images, detecting objects within them and drawing bounding boxes around the detected objects.

Object detection in videos: The project can read video files and perform object detection frame by frame. Detected objects are highlighted in real-time.

Webcam-based object detection: Using your computer's webcam, the project performs object detection on the live feed. This feature can be used for real-time applications, such as monitoring security cameras or interactive installations.

Configurable confidence threshold: The confidence threshold for object detection is configurable, allowing you to fine-tune the sensitivity of the detection process.

## Technologies Used

OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image and video analysis, including object detection.

MobileNet SSD: A deep neural network architecture optimized for mobile devices that can efficiently perform object detection.

Python: The programming language used for building and running the project.
